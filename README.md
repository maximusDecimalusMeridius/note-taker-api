## Description

This challenge was to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes with unique IDs.  It uses Express.js for the backend and retrieves notes data from a server-side JSON file.  The front-end code was cloned but I built the backend, connected the two, and deployed it to Heroku.

### User Story
```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a note-taking application

WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page

WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes

WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column

WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```
